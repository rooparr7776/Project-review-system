# Faculty Roles Update Summary

## What Was Accomplished

Your faculty login system has been successfully updated to give every faculty member multiple roles (guide, panel member, and coordinator) with a **role switching system** that allows them to access all dashboards from a single login.

## Current Status

âœ… **All faculty users now have the following three roles:**
- **Guide** - Can manage teams, upload attendance, and mark students
- **Panel Member** - Can participate in review panels and assignments  
- **Coordinator** - Can manage review schedules and coordinate activities

âœ… **Role Switching System Implemented:**
- Faculty users see **ALL their roles** when they log in
- They can **switch between roles** to access different dashboards
